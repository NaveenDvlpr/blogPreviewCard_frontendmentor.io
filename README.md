## Overview

In this frontend challenge i wrote code for blog design where the task is done using plain HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Solution URL: 
- Live Site URL: 

## My process

After downloading the starter file I changed the index.html file to add tags to give a better structure to the blog and this maded them to access better for CSS. 

As there is only one bigger component(Blog) in the page it is better to keep in center in both axis as it gives a proper look to the page i did it by traditional centering method

After that i understood that padding playing a role and width of the blog is also playing a role to give a proper centered design

Box Shadow on the blog gaved a beautiful look to the blog


### Built with

HyperText Markup Language(HTML)
Cascading StyleSheets(CSS)


### What I learned

width: max-content;

While working on this project i encountered with a problem of inbuilt width of div which is block level when i changed the background color it is covering complete width of blog i wanted the background color to be only around of the content this can be done by 4 ways according to tutorialspoint.com i used width property with max-content value

box-shadow: 10px 10px;

Box shadow is an amazing styling property as it can give some 3d life to the elements. By my understanding it has 3 properties 1st shadow in the right direction x-axis negative value moves the shadow to left direction similarly 2nd is for shadow along y-axis and 3rd is for color of the shadow if not mentioned it taken as black.


### Continued development

In the starter file we have an image for active state where we can see when title is hovered it changes it's color and cursor type and what i can the hand pointer color is black i googled while doing the challenge but not found any source i will try to do it by taking time as it can make our UI's more customizable

I am a starter in frontend so i try to rectify my mistakes and size issues after submission
